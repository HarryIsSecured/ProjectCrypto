        <h2>The ongoing Crypto Wars</h2>
        <p class = "text-box">Crypto Wars

            WARNING: This follows on after the WWII cryptography history lessons in chronological order. Unless you specifically want information on the crypto wars, please, go back and look at our WWII section.
            
            This section serves to focus on providing knowledge of the crypto wars, as well as other events occurring around the time to allow you to understand the landscape and draw your conclusions from this topic.
            
            The crypto wars is an ongoing series of wars of which the commercial sector and general public disagree with a government, and engage in diplomacy or activism against them; dating back as early as 1954. So let’s cast our minds back as we set the scene. It’s November 1954, the United States of America is under pressure to limit exports of military goods to other countries following the Truman Doctrine in 1947. After battling in two world wars, and still facing extreme pressure by the Soviet Union, the U.S. placed cryptography on the U.S. Munitions List under ‘Auxiliary Military Equipment’. Going back to WWII, where the U.K. cracked the Enigma cypher, which significantly counted towards the Allies success. The U.S. and U.K. wanted to protect their advancements in cryptography by blocking other countries from accessing their secrets. This did lead to many issues, but we’ll get to that later. So it’s 1954, for reference the Cuban missile crisis occurred in 1962. Hence, both sides were well underway during the Cold War, and this wasn’t seen as much of a significant issue by any party as encryption had significantly been a military and government only process. Many cryptography types such as RSA, ECC, PGP didn’t exist at this time, simply because many people didn’t yet encryption have a necessity to encrypt their data. This did change; however, let’s take you forwards 21 years to 1977 to present DES. DES is the U.S. Government’s first publicly accessible encryption algorithm standard created and published by IBM.
            
            DES or Data Encryption Standard (we cover DES on another page, make sure to check that out!) released to the United State’s population for use as a government-sponsored encryption technique. Introduced as a 40/56 bit key (with an 8-bit checksum resulting in 48/64 keys) it was accepted by the American public. Still, it was quickly spread internationally for the citizens and governments of other countries to use unofficially. Lucifer’s key, which was the block cypher (symmetric encryption algorithm) created by Horst Feistel and IBM, was placed at a block size of 128. This key was used to develop DES; however, the NSA reduced the block size to either 48/64 (with a cypher size of 40/56) before DES was designed around this new Feistel-network version of Lucifer key. The NSA did attempt to make a block size of 48 the norm, but IBM compromised on 56 as their standard. This was the start of multiple failings at the attempt to keep cryptography algorithms or standards secret or hidden by bodies of the U.S. government. If 56 bits doesn’t sound like a lot, that’s because it wasn’t. With an update released by the U.S.’s NSA which weakened the standard’s algorithm by making it more susceptible to brute-force attacks (an iteration through every possible combination until the key is found) while making it stronger versus differential cryptanalysis (the differences in multiple cryptographic outputs, from using different inputs and calculating similarities). You can argue whether this was worth the knock on it’s vulnerabilities to brute-force attacks, but again we shall come back to that soon. The networks and technologies that predate the introduction of the World Wide Web such as the NPL network (from the U.K.’s National Physics Laboratory) or the one most of us will be familiar with, ARPANET (from the U.S’ Department of Defence agency, Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency or DARPA). With the introduction of these networks and the definition of a future global network, the war between the Cypherpunk movement and the U.S. Government was now well on the way.
            
            It’s now the early 1990s; the World Wide Web has been released by the father of the internet, Tim Berners-Lee, everyone’s excited about a global network connecting computers available for free (minus the broadcast cost). No one was as excited as potential hackers, while mathematicians and cryptographers alike shuddered; here’s why. Many people have known for year’s that DES would not have been sufficient as it was introduced to the internet as a 40-bit key. There is a rumour that the NSA had foolishly claimed that DES would take 91 years to brute force. Cypherpunks (said mathematicians and cryptographers) were now working to debunk as the NSA and NIST refused to acknowledge how insecure their mainstream 40-bit key was or to prove that the key wouldn’t last long as they factored in increasing computational power. A strange shift was found here for many new cypherpunks who once only imagined the more robust encryption they seek to apply to everyone’s daily life, would also be a leading tool used by them to prevent spying. Casting our minds back even further, we know that governments have always tried to keep tabs on what its citizens are doing, especially activists. Focusing on an activist most people have heard of, Martin Luther King, we know that his communications were actually being monitored and listened in too. They had to rely on DES to secure both internet data, as well as phone communications using a new (1993) technology developed by the NSA, which did encryption on a chip. Namely the ‘Cipher Chip’, using an encryption standard similar to DES but as a size of 80 bits.
            
            So, in the end, DES could help them remain anonymous at this point, right.. right? Wrong. Welcome to the land of government agency backdoors (a backdoor is either an unintentional or intentional bypass to get around policy or feature) which run rampant as countries try to have an upper-hand. Citizens and the commercial sector tend to report backdoors for either improving a service or product, collecting large bug bounties or both. Government’s, on the other hand, tend to be more selfish and keep backdoor’s to themselves for a considerable period before divulging them, if ever.
            
            While the NSA claims not to have intentionally placed a backdoor in DES alongside IBM, one of the most straightforward ways this was done was through introducing S-boxes (substitution boxes) which as aforementioned made the algorithm stronger against differential cryptanalysis, but reduced IBM’s original key size using lucifer’s key of 128 to the agreed block size of either 48 or 64. This meant that the NSA could use all of its computing power to brute force the keys. In essence, the NSA says that brute-force attack’s can’t be considered intentional backdoors, even if the this was the reason behind decreasing key sizes, as brute-force attacks can theoretically work against any target, given a certain amount of constant processing speed and a period. To put this into the perspective of how broad the NSA is here, we present the perfect summary of this issue by Bruce Schneier, a lecturer at Harvard University and a member of the EFF. “Modern algorithms have a key so long that this is impossible; even if you built a computer out of all the silicon atoms on the planet and ran it for millions of years, you couldn’t do it”. However, some cypherpunks have argued that knowingly making a key size smaller leads to a backdoor process; useful encryption algorithms have both of the following, strong mathematics, and large key sizes. It’s the same reason you won’t find a key below the size of 128 bits, even on some old browsers! From this section, we have gathered that activists such as the cypherpunks didn’t trust the government, and using a standard in which they had a say in and in some of their eyes left a U.S. only backdoor system in which made them trust the encryption standard even less.
            
            “So deCryptMe, what did they do,” you ask? Enter the vast world of PGP or Pretty Good Privacy, released in 1991 by Phil Zimmermann who mixes the main cryptography methods of hashing (a one-way algorithm that is near impossible to invert) and symmetric-key encryption. Still dramatically used to this day, it is one the easiest ways to send encrypted data as long as you have said person or organisation’s public key. Phil wanted to support cypherpunks and activists of over movements to have communications without the interference or watchful eye of the government. In an attempt to allow people across the U.S. to avoid big brother, Phil placed his PGP code on a personal FTP server. However, while not Phil’s initial idea to allow PGP to spread outside of the U.S. we find that anything placed on the internet has the risk of being accessed by anyone else in the world. As PGP was now being used outside of the U.S. as well, the U.S. Customs Service for allowing this spread as cryptography was still under the Munitions List. This meant that Phil was now in violation of the Arms Export Control Act; in essence Phil was being placed under the rules that one exporting military grade submarines and tanks would face. Even businesses were using PGP during this time, as long as their PGP messages didn’t leave the country, they were legally allowed to continue using them. Many had made the switch as while DES was strong, the adversaries to DES was growing and companies understood that civilian grade encryption could be soon cracked by civilians. Phil’s run ins with the government continued for numerous years and was supported by organisations and the general public as they cried out for stronger encryption standards. But, the NSA and NIST continued to preach that 40-bit DES was still strong enough, while local and federal law enforcement echoed cypherpunk’s worse nightmare, weak encryption was pushed through by the government to crack encryptions for criminals. A sentiment that the public shared was that having stronger encryption which in turn made it harder for criminals to access their data was better than having weaker encryption but law enforcement has a slightly higher chance of catching them.

            3DES is considered no longer secure due to collision attacks; we at deCryptMe recommend you use AES or RSA which are much less susceptible to attacks as of August 2020. To protect yourself, PGP is a brilliant solution to sending and receiving encrypted data which may play an essential role in your life.
